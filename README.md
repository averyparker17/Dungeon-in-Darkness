# Dungeon-in-Darkness
Project for Full Stack

This project is a text-based adventure meant to display my skills in creating classes and functions and utilizing if statements and loops.
The project will offer users a selection of choices during different moments in the game, and the player's choice will influence the outcome of the game.

The project will be coded in the C++ language.
